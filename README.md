## ⚙️ Design & Working Principle

1. **User approaches within 20 cm.**
2. **Ultrasonic sensor detects proximity** and sends signal to ESP8266.
3. **Servo motor rotates**, opening the lid automatically.
4. **After a short delay**, the servo closes the lid.
5. **Standby mode activates** to save power until the next detection event.
